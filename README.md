## Vicky Roberts

I'm a junior full-stack web developer, recently graduated from Maker's Academy in London. 

Passionate about working in the creative industries, I have ten years' experience working for television broadcasters and magazine publishers, prior to learning how to code. 

I love languages, new challenges, have a good eye for detail and a good head for problem-solving.
